## Session Start Checklist

**Before executing any task, you MUST:**
1. Read `PROJECT.md` for business context and scope boundaries
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical context and patterns
3. Read `AI_CODING_GUIDELINES.md` for coding standards
4. Skim the last 2-3 entries in `SESSION_LOG.md` for recent context
5. Confirm you understand the task scope — ask if unclear

Do not skip these steps. Do not assume.
