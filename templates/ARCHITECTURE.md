# Technical Architecture

> **Claude:** This defines HOW we're building it. Read this before writing code. Update it when technical decisions change.

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Language | Python 3.x | |
| Framework | | |
| Database | | |
| APIs | | |
| Hosting | | |

## Project Structure
```

## Key Patterns
*(How things work in this codebase)*
- **Data flow:**
- **Error handling:**
- **Configuration:** `.env` for secrets, config at top of files

## External Dependencies
| Service/API | Purpose | Auth Method |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| | | |

## Data Models
*(Key entities and their relationships — add as you build)*

## Technical Decisions
*(Log significant choices and WHY — prevents re-litigating)*
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| | | |

## Known Technical Debt
*(Things to fix later — be honest)*
